Welcome to our app  **SPORTSCAST**. Our aim is to give users a general idea of what the weather will be for upcoming oudoor sporting events that they will attend so they can make plans accordingly.


* Registered users will be able to select from major football, baseball and soccer events.
* When our users are prompted to choose from a calendar of events **SPORTSCAST** will return gorgeous visual data in the form of charts & graphs of the temperature, precipitation (if any) and general climate of the region at that time, based on data from previous games and dates.
* **SPORTSCAST** will store search queries and and allow users to share the data with friends and family.
